#  A suprise and a rare blessing

Hear Hear ! Dear Stardew Valley citizens, it has happened. The frantic farmer, who had ventured off to Ginger Island after some traumatic experience regarding some Ostrich device, has returned.
 
However, today they re-appeared - to everyone's surprise - not from the Ginger Island Ferry but came storming back into the valley from the Calico Desert Bus.
 
They were spotted carrying, or rather "dragging", a heavy ancient device to their farm.
 
After some investigation on our side, looking at the photos that the town folks took of this rather peculiar item whilst the farmer dragged it in exhaustion along the dusty road to their farm, we found that.. In their possession is.. a rarity.. a bless in disguise !
 
They seem to have acquired a so called **Auto-Petter** ! 🐮
 
We have not seen such a device in at least a century here in our beloved hometown.
We can only imagine how relieved this farmer must be, as we country people all know just too well how exhausting it can be to keep up the mood of your farm animals on a daily basis.
 
We hope they are up for some interview with us, to let us know more about this intriguing find !
