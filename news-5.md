#  Terra-Terraria

What in the world is this farmer up to now again ?

Every day we have reports of them carrying around curious items, just to drag, hieve and tow them towards their farm.

When Marlon did his evening check in the upper levels of the mines, to ensure that none of the monsters escape and roam into the valley, he was able to snap a photo of the farmer.
They were, this time, transporting a heavy green jewel, holding it up right over their head.

We've showed the photo to Gunther, the expert for artefacts here in Stardew. According to a book found deep in his librrary, this particular jewel is called a "Pylon".

The book describes, Gunther says, that whence the pylon is brought to the basement of a Wizard's tower, and installed correctly one could open a portal to another world, named **Terraria**.

It promises great treasures, gears of war. What exactly will be found is not described. But Gunter says every time he opened this particular page in the book, cat 😺 sounds seem to appear out of nowhere, and the air starts to sparkle in rainbow colored bands. 🌈

We wonder if Magnus, the local wizard, knows more...
