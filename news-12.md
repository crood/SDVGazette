# Old Rattling Bones

Sometimes bones 🦴 are perfect for a rich, tasty broth… but these particular bones? Let’s just say they’re a little too out of date for soup.

Should you toss them aside when you find them?

Normally, yes.

But remember that old fellow the farmer rescued from the caves on Ginger Island? 
As it turns out, he’s an archaeological expert by the name of **Doctor Snail** and he absolutely adores bones.

With no distant family members or friends ever coming to fetch him from his new homestead (a cozy little tent near the digging site), the good doctor has done the only sensible thing:

He’s opened a **Museum**!

Because even in your golden years, one must keep busy...

The very first exhibits, who would’ve guessed? Were generously donated by none other than Stardew Valley’s very own farmer. However, a few pieces are still missing from the two larger creatures. We hear the **Snake** bones, in particular, are notoriously difficult to find.

So next time you’re wandering Ginger Island, don’t just dig for treasure, dig for history! 
Unearth those prehistoric bones and make an old man’s day by donating them to his charming, makeshift museum.

Who knew fossils could be the island’s hottest attraction?
