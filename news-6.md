# Prisoner of the Cave

Today, to our surprise, we obtained a letter from our new farmer. They just wanted to let us, the local newspaper, and in turn the town's folks, know that they freed an old man from a **cave** on Ginger Island.

The farmer was concerned that someone was missing this old man. Maybe his family, maybe his friends. Though the farmer mentions this lost soul seems very old, and they wouldn't know if he has relatives that'd be still ... let's say... 'alive'. 

They then rambled for a few more sentences about reimbursement of expenses. It seems they had to use one or more of their home-made **bombs** to get inside of the cave. They then concluded that it would be okay as a life was rescued that day, and ended the paragraph with a sudden "whatever".

Nonetheless, they wanted to make sure to let everyone know, that in case someone knows him, he can be picked up at a **tent** near the **digging site** on **Ginger Island**.

The farmer did pass along to us, that it is very important, to not let this old man anywhere near **Cave Mushroom Salad** as there may be some traumatic connection.
