#  A minor accident ???

Important news ! To all Stardew citizens, located on the west side of the valley, please be cautious.

Or do you have to be ???

Actually we are not sure what we wanted to warn you about.

All of our news reporters are mumbling something about memories, of an explosion in the late afternoon, but now... it is **morning**.. **not afternoon**.


We are all very confused. But have decided to print this article anyways. Just in case.


It almost feels like the time has turned back, and the day has **restarted** itself. 

Maybe we all have just fallen victim to a wide spread Mandela Effect, we guess we'll never know...
