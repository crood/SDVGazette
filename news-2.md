#  🔥 A farmer in despair 🔥

The farmer who has been reported earlier today  to have found an ostrich egg and was later giving an excited interview has been spotted running around restless in the town.
 
When approached, they muttered in an upset manner and screamed that they've tried to place the egg in the incubator for several hours, just to find out they needed some special ostrich incubator .. which they don't have access to!
 
They were then seen running off into the distance towards the ferry to Ginger Island.
 
The town is wondering about what they might be up to, and everyone is speaking about this odd encounter.
