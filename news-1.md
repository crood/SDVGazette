#  The oval 'thing'

Today an **Ostrich Egg** 🥚 was found under one of the many bendy palm trees on **Ginger Island**. The farmer who came into the possession of the egg has swiftly transported it, all the way across the ocean, into the warm embrace of their **Deluxe Barn**, to hopefully soon hatch a new addition to their beloved flock of farm birds. 
 
The farmer said in the interview, they have no plans to eat the bird, but rather raise and care for it in the hope of obtaining large eggs and maybe some fancy mayonnaise that might sell for a good price in the local markets of Stardew Valley.
