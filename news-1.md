#  The oval 'thing'

Today an **Ostrich Egg** 🥚 was found in the deep ends of the vulcano on Ginger Island. The farmer who came into the possession of the egg has swiftly transported it, all the way across the ocean, into the warm embrace of their Deluxe Coop, to hopefully soon hatch a new addition to their beloved flock of farm birds. 
 
The farmer said in the interview, they have no plans on eating the bird, but rather raise and care for it in the hopes of obtaining large eggs and maybe some fancy mayonnaise that might sell for good cash in the local markets of Stardew Valley.
