#  RIBBIT - The Story of a Craving

Sometimes, when you sit long enough in a dark cave with nothing but a few smoking pipes filled with who-knows-what hallucinogenic “tobacco,” you simply forget to leave.

You wake up one day to realize you’ve spent years dreaming and imagining things about life and the universe itself.

When the filling for your “puffing” devices runs out, you discover you haven’t eaten in what feels like an eternity. While your mind was traveling, your body was aging. Now you are too old to move, craving one last meal reminiscent of what you once loved.

Gourmand, as he is called, found himself in precisely this situation.

Luckily, a farmer (Stardew Valley’s newest citizen) came wandering by on their way back from the horrors of the island’s volcano, seeking rest in the warmth of their tropical home on Ginger Island. Just before reaching their homestead, they noticed the entrance to the cave where Gourmand had long since forgotten both time and himself.

Gourmand had needs. Strong cravings. And they had to be fulfilled.

The poor farmer, who wanted nothing more than sleep and recovery, now had to plant a **pink melon**, some **wheat**, and of all things ... **garlic**.

By now immovable and half-blind, Gourmand insisted the crops be planted within his sight, so he could witness it done properly and catch one last glimpse of what he once loved to eat.

Once the farmer finished the task and the crops had grown, they returned to inform him. 


To everyone’s surprise, the formerly **pretend-to-be-handicapped toad suddenly ran to the crops**.

One might wonder why he hadn’t planted them himself. But when you’re paid handsomely in **golden walnuts** 🥜, you don’t ask too many questions.

To this day, no one understands why, when he finally stood before the food he had craved for so long, he only spoke of  memories, recalling how they once tasted.

He did not eat a single bite.


Perhaps, after such a long time without food, his digestive system was no longer up to the task.
