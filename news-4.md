#  Powder Giants

In the wee morning hours, shortly after the morningly rooster wakeup call, the entire town could hear screams. Firstly sounding like panic and fear, but suddenly turning into pure excitement.
Where did the screams come from ? According to Pam, who was on her way to her Bus-Driver shift for the day, she located them to be coming from the westside ranch.

We are nearing the end of year 3, after which a new farmer had moved in on the plot, following into the foot steps of their grandfather who fell sick.

Pam's curiosity got the better of her and she went over to have a peak. There could be maybe a party? A chance for some of her beloved pale ale ?.. what's not to be liked if that's the case ?!

The reality of what was happening, was underwhelming.. at least to Pam, who'd hoped for a sip of old fashioned brew. But quite amazing to anyone interested in successful farming.

It was the first winter this greenhorn of a farmer had planted an entire field with just one crop, and due to good care and fertilizers across the field several adjacent Powder Melons turned into large blue giants !

Pam says she was about to yell at the farmer to not make such a big deal out of it, but stopped herself, and decided to leave them to enjoy their 'success'.

Townfolks now are hoping to get a share of this massive yield, and maybe obtain a big jar of Powdermelon Jelly as gift on the day of the Feast of the Winterstar.
