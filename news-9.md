# 💣 A minor accident

Important news ! To all Stardew citizens, located on the west side of the valley, please be cautious.

Today a huge explosion occurred on our new farmer's ranch. 

Marnie, who is living south of the ranch came running with buckets full of water to help extinguish the fires that came to be as result of the explosion.
She brought along a herd of her cows to which she had strapped even more water buckets. 

One may say Marnie has proven herself to be a **Cow-Powered-Fire-Tuck**.

Our reporter at the scene found that five of the farmer's **Crystalariums** were blown out of existence... or rather ... completely eradicated.


Marnie told the news reporter that she had tried to calm the farmer, they were extremely upset because they managed to accidentally release a bomb from their backpack, just after they managed to get a somewhat stable small scale **Jade** replication set up.
The farmer, however, just turned around to be alone for a while in their nearby shed.


They'd left the scene with the words ***"Excuse me M'am, I'ma need a moment by myself"***
