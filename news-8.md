#  Frozen (but without Elsa)

Today the townsfolk heard a song coming from the depths of the **mines** near the **mountain lake**.

It went something like this:

🎶"its's a bad day, to be a slime, in the mine"🎶

Shortly thereafter, half-frozen slimes ran all over the town in pure despair and fear. We believe they were seeking cover in the sewers, and that someone has gotten their hands on one of them **ice rods*.


We here at the Stardew Valley Gazette have been taking bets as high as 10,000 gold 🪙 on whether this will finally cause **Krobus** to leave that reeking **sewer** and step into the daylight.

We’ll keep you posted on the outcome.
